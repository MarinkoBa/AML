# AML

#### The goal is to build a binary/multi class classificator, which will be able to distinguish between COVID-19, Pneumonia and Normal classes of X-ray chest images. Due to the current COVID-19 situation the radiologists could need help while recognizing positive COVID-19 cases.

#### Dataset
For training of the network we used the Chest X-ray dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/prashant268/chest-xray-covid19-pneumonia). Dataset is organized into 2 folders (train, test) and both train and test contain 3 subfolders (COVID19, PNEUMONIA, NORMAL). DataSet contains total 6432 x-ray images and test data have 20% of total images.

#### Chest X Ray images data directory structure:
	- data 
		- test
			- COVID19
       				- *.jpg
			- NORMAL
       				- *.jpg
			- PNEUMONIA
       				- *.jpg
		- train
			- COVID19
       				- *.jpg
			- NORMAL
       				- *.jpg
			- PNEUMONIA
       				- *.jpg



#### Done

- Preprocessing including reshaping
- Implementation Xception network
- Implementation DarkCovid network
- First Training/Performance test with unbalanced data set

#### TO DO
- Implementation of Metrics (Recall, Secificity, Precision, F1-Score, Accuracy)
- Data Augmentation: Random rotation angle  = 10Â°, Horisontal Flip and Zoom Range = 0.4
- Balanced Dataset: ~500x Covid, ~500x Normal, ~500x Pneunomia (randomly picked from the sets) and increase dataset with augmentation to 1500x Covid, 1500x Normal, 1500x Pneunomia. The original train set includes 460 Covid (300 RGB, 124 L, 36 RGBA -> for differences see https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/concepts.html#concept-modes), 1266 Normal and 3418 Pneunomia images.
			
- Implementation of 2D DenseNet
- 5-fold Cross Validation to Compare the Models
- Maybe: build Ensemble of the Models and test performance
