# AML

#### The goal is to build a binary/multi class classificator, which will be able to distinguish between COVID-19, Pneumonia and Normal classes of X-ray chest images. Due to the current COVID-19 situation the radiologists could need help while recognizing positive COVID-19 cases. 


#### Chest X Ray images data directory structure:
	- data 
		- test
			- COVID19
       - *.jpg
      - NORMAL
       - *.jpg
      - PNEUMONIA
       - *.jpg
		- train
			- COVID19
       - *.jpg
      - NORMAL
       - *.jpg
      - PNEUMONIA
